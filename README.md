### sysctl

The `debops.sysctl` Ansible role manages Linux kernel parameters. It
comes with kernel hardening and shared memory optimization enabled by
default. The kernel hardening is ported from
[hardening.os-hardening](https://github.com/hardening-io/ansible-os-hardening)
for optimal compatibility with DebOps.

Read the [sysctl role documentation](https://docs.debops.org/en/stable-2.1/ansible/roles/sysctl/) for more details.
